# 📦 Queue Projects in Java

This folder contains two Java-based queue projects:

1. 🛠️ **Custom Queue Implementation (from scratch using Linked List)**
2. ⚙️ **Document Printer using Java Built-in Queue**

Each project demonstrates a different aspect of how queues work in Java, both conceptually and practically.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 1️⃣ Custom Queue Implementation

- Created a generic queue class `NewQueue<T>` using singly linked list.
- Implemented common queue operations:
  - `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `peek()`, `getRear()`, `size()`, `clear()`, `display()`
- Extra functionalities:
  - `contains()`, `indexOf()`, `toArrayList()`, `reverse()`, `clone()`

> 🎯 **Learning Goal:** Understand how queues work internally, node-by-node.

### 2️⃣ Document Printing System (Built-in Queue)

- Simulates a document printing queue using Java's `Queue` interface (`LinkedList` implementation).
- Features include:
  - Adding, printing, and displaying documents
  - Tracking timestamps using `LocalDateTime`
  - Counting printed documents
  - Menu-driven CLI interaction

> 🎯 **Learning Goal:** Practice using Java built-in data structures in real-world use cases.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Difference between implementing a data structure from scratch vs. using built-in classes
- Java Generics and Object-Oriented Design
- Working with `LocalDateTime`, `DateTimeFormatter`, and `Scanner`
- Exception handling in menu-based console apps
