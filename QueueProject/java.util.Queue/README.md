# 🖨️ Document Printing Queue System (Using Java Built-in Queue)

This project simulates a simple document printing system using Java's built-in `Queue` interface (`LinkedList` implementation).  
Users can add documents, print them in order (FIFO), and track printing activity with timestamps.

---

## 📌 Features

- Add new documents to the queue
- Print documents (first come, first served)
- View all documents in the queue
- Check the number of documents waiting
- See the first document in the queue
- Clear all documents
- Track the number of printed documents
- Show the date and time each document was added and printed

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java `Queue` (via `LinkedList`)
- Java `Scanner` for user input
- `LocalDateTime` and `DateTimeFormatter` for timestamps
- Custom `Document` class for document data

🧠 Learning Purpose

This project is built **for educational purposes**, especially to practice:

- Using Java’s standard library (`Queue`, `LinkedList`)
- Object-Oriented Programming with custom classes
- Working with date/time in Java
- Exception handling and clean user interaction

This project is part of my learning journey to master Java and Data Structures.
