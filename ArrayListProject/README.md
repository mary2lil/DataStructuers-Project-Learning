# 📦 Java ArrayList Projects

Welcome to my Java `ArrayList` learning repository!  
This folder contains a collection of small, focused projects built to understand and apply the concept of `ArrayList` in Java — both by using the built-in `ArrayList` and by implementing a custom version from scratch.

## 📘 Contents

### 1. `NewArrayList` (Custom Implementation)
- A generic class that mimics Java's built-in `ArrayList` features.
- Supports:
  - Adding elements
  - Inserting at specific index
  - Removing by index or last element
  - Searching
  - Resizing the internal array dynamically
  - Clearing the list
  - Checking if the list is empty or full

### 2. `Student Grades Manager`
- A simple project that manages student grades using the built-in `ArrayList<Double>`.
- Features:
  - Add grades with validation
  - Calculate max, min, and average
  - Determine letter grade (A, B, C, F)
  - Practice on real use of ArrayList methods

## 🧠 Why this repo?
- Practice OOP in Java with real-life inspired examples.
- Improve understanding of `ArrayList` under the hood.
- Prepare for data structures and algorithms.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java
- `ArrayList` from `java.util`
- Basic OOP concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation, exceptions

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project folder in any Java IDE.
2. Each subproject contains a `main` method to test.
3. Run and observe the output in the console.
