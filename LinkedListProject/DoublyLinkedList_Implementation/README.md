# Doubly Linked List in Java 🟦

This is a custom implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** in Java, built from scratch for learning and practicing fundamental data structure concepts.

## 📌 Features

- `addFirst(T element)` – Add element at the beginning.
- `addLast(T element)` – Add element at the end.
- `addAt(int index, T element)` – Add element at a specific index.
- `removeFirst()` – Remove the first element.
- `removeLast()` – Remove the last element.
- `removeAt(int index)` – Remove element at specific index.
- `getFirst()` – Get the first element.
- `getLast()` – Get the last element.
- `getElement(int index)` – Get element at a specific index.
- `contains(T element)` – Check if the list contains an element.
- `getIndex(T element)` – Get the index of an element.
- `set(int index, T element)` – Update value at index.
- `reverse()` – Reverse the linked list.
- `swap(int i, int j)` – Swap two elements by index.
- `toArray()` – Convert to an array.
- `toArrayList()` – Convert to an ArrayList.
- `iterator()` – Support for enhanced for loop.
- `equals(NewLinkedList<T> other)` – Compare two lists.
- `clear()` – Clear the list.
- `displayForward()` – Print list forward.
- `displayBackward()` – Print list backward.
- `size()` – Return number of elements.

## 📚 Learning Purpose

This project was built as part of my data structures learning journey using Java.  
It helped me understand how nodes are linked together in both directions, and how to manipulate them safely.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Add support for circular doubly linked list
- Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort on the list)
- Add unit tests for better reliability
