# LinkedList Data Structures 📚

This folder contains different implementations and usages of **LinkedList** in Java, including:

- **Singly LinkedList** (custom implementation) 🔗  
- **Doubly LinkedList** (custom implementation with two-way links) 🔄  
- **Built-in LinkedList** from Java Collections Framework 🧰  

---

## Folder Structure 📂

- **SinglyLinkedList/**  
  Contains classes and methods implementing a singly linked list where each node points only to the next node. Basic operations like add, remove, reverse, search, and more are implemented here.  

- **DoublyLinkedList/**  
  Contains classes and methods implementing a doubly linked list where each node points to both previous and next nodes. Supports advanced operations like bidirectional traversal, reverse, insertions, deletions at any position, etc.  

- **BuiltInLinkedList/**  
  Examples and practice code using Java's built-in `LinkedList` class from `java.util` package. Includes usage demos for common list operations and integration with custom objects.

## Key Concepts Covered 🧠

- Node structure and links 🔗  
- Traversal and iteration techniques 🔄  
- Insertions and deletions at head, tail, and arbitrary positions ➕➖  
- Searching and updating nodes 🔍  
- Reversing linked lists ↩️  
- Handling edge cases and exceptions ⚠️  
- Comparing custom linked list implementations with Java’s built-in LinkedList 🧰  

---

## How to Use 🚀

1. Navigate to the desired folder (SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, or BuiltInLinkedList).  
2. Open and run the Java classes to test different linked list operations.  
3. Study the code to understand implementation details and best practices.

## Future Plans 🌱

- Implement **Circular LinkedList**  
- Add more complex algorithms on LinkedLists (e.g., merge, sort)  
- Create GUI-based visualizations for LinkedList operations
