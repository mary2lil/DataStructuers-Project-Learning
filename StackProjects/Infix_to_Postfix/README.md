ðŸ˜Ž Infix to Postfix Converter (Java)

This simple Java project converts a mathematical expression from infix notation (e.g. A + B * C) to postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation, e.g. ABC*+).

---

 ðŸ“Œ What is Infix and Postfix?

- Infix: The common way we write expressions, e.g., A + B .
- Postfix: Operators come *after* the operands, e.g., AB+ .

Postfix notation is used in compilers and interpreters to evaluate expressions efficiently using stacks.

 ðŸ“¦ Features

- Supports:
  - Operands (letters or digits)
  - Operators: + , - , * , / .
  - Parentheses: () .

- Handles operator precedence:
  - *  , /  have higher precedence than + , - .
- Ignores white spaces
- Prints postfix result to console

ðŸ§ª Example

Input: (A + B) * (C - D)
Output : A B + C D - *

 ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open your Java IDE or terminal.
2. Compile the file.
3. Run the program.
4. Enter any valid infix expression (e.g., A+(B*C) ).
5. See the result in postfix.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Stack data structure
- Expression parsing
- Operator precedence
- Parentheses handling

---
This version assumes single-character operands and does not support multi-digit numbers or error handling for invalid expressions yet.
