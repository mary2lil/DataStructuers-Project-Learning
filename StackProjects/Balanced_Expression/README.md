ðŸ”¢ Balanced Expression Checker

This Java program checks whether a given expression has balanced parentheses , including:

- Round brackets: `()`
- Curly braces: `{}`
- Square brackets: `[]`

âœ… Purpose

This is a classic application of the Stack data structure , where we use a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensure they are correctly closed in the right order.

---

ðŸ§  How it works

- Each time the program finds an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.
- When it finds a closing bracket, it checks if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket.
- If all brackets match correctly, and the stack is empty at the end, the expression is balanced.
