Stack Project ðŸ§±

This repository showcases multiple Java implementations and applications of the Stack data structure.  
Itâ€™s part of my journey to master Data Structures in Java through self-learning and practice.

 ðŸ“š Contents

 1. Stack Using Java's Built-in Stack
- Uses java.util.Stack
- Demonstrates basic stack operations like push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

 2. Stack Using Linked List
- Custom stack implementation using a singly linked list.
- Node-based structure to handle dynamic memory efficiently.
- Manual handling of pointers (`next`) for full control.

 3. Stack Using ArrayList
- Custom stack implementation using ArrayList.
- Simulates push, pop, peek, size, isEmpty, clear, and display.
- Emphasizes array-based stack behavior and custom handling of top index.

 4. Balanced Expression Checker
- Checks if an expression has balanced parentheses (), {}, [].
- Uses stack to track and validate brackets.
- Example: {[(())]} â†’ âœ… Balanced

5. Infix to Postfix Converter
- Converts infix arithmetic expressions (e.g., A+B*C) to postfix form (ABC*+).
- Uses operator precedence and stack-based conversion.
- Useful for parsing expressions in compilers or calculators.

 ðŸ“Œ Why This Project?
- Reinforce understanding of stacks from both theoretical and practical angles.
- Compare built-in vs custom implementations.
- Apply stacks to real problems like expression parsing and validation.

 ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
- Add unit tests for all implementations.
- Expand infix to postfix to support multi-digit numbers and spacing.
- Add postfix evaluation feature.
