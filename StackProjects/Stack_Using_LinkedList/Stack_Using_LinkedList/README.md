 😎 CallStack - Generic Stack Implementation Using Linked List in Java

This project implements a generic stack data structure using a singly linked list in Java.  
You can store any type of data (thanks to generics) and perform basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, search, and more.

 📝 Notes : 
. The project uses a custom Node<T> class internally to manage linked list nodes.

. The CallStack<T> class handles all stack operations.

. Generics allow you to create a stack of any object type, such as Integer, String, or even your own classes.
